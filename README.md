This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start-server` for starting a local server with mock data. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Separate build commands are used for each environment.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `npm run build:prod` to build for production. 
Run `npm run build:uat` to build for deploy. 
Run `npm run build:dev` to build for develop. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
